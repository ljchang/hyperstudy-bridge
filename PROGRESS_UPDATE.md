# Progress Update - September 15, 2025

## Session Summary

This development session focused on fixing critical issues, improving accessibility, and completing Phase 4 of the HyperStudy Bridge project.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Critical Build Issues
- **Resolved import errors** in LslConfigPanel component
- **Added missing exports** (`sendMessage` and `subscribe`) to WebSocket store
- **Fixed build configuration** ensuring clean compilation
- **Application now runs successfully** with WebSocket server active on port 9000

### 2. Accessibility Improvements (100% Complete)
Fixed all WCAG accessibility warnings across all components:
- **AddDeviceModal** - Added proper ARIA roles and keyboard handlers
- **LogViewer** - Fixed modal overlay accessibility
- **DeviceConfigModal** - Added presentation role and keyboard navigation
- **SettingsPanel** - Associated all form labels with controls
- **LslConfigPanel** - Fixed non-interactive element interactions

Changes ensure:
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Form control associations

### 3. Phase 4 Completion - Device Testing & Documentation

#### Testing Implementation
- **TTL Device Tests** (`ttl_tests.rs`)
  - Unit tests for configuration, connection, and state management
  - Integration tests with hardware mocking
  - Performance callback verification

- **Kernel Device Tests** (`kernel_tests.rs`)
  - TCP connection testing
  - Reconnection logic validation
  - Buffer overflow handling

#### Documentation
- **TTL Protocol Documentation** (`docs/TTL_PROTOCOL.md`)
  - Complete protocol specification
  - Hardware requirements (hyperstudy-ttl)
  - Serial communication details (115200 baud, 8N1)
  - Command format and responses
  - Performance requirements (<1ms latency)
  - Firmware implementation guide
  - Troubleshooting section
